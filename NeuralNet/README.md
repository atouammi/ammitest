# BootCamp AMMI 2024- Neural Network


## This repositories contains some implementation from scratch of Neural network


### This code has :
- A class `Layer Dense` tha I use to after to create my layers
- A class Activation of activation functions `Sigmoid`, ` ReLu` ,`Soltmax`, but I use only  the `Sigmoid`
- Script for the training , using Gradient descent as Optimizer and `NLL` as a loss function

- Some functions: `prediction()` and , `Accuracy`
